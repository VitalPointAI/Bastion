**Rule:** Never use dark backgrounds. Never use tactical/military dark aesthetic. BASTION on the second screen provides the tactical visual; the deck is the clean analytical layer.

## Purpose
Show the five-tier authority model with the robot autonomy example — the payoff of the opening demo. The robot stopped and asked for permission in the demo. This slide explains why. The five tiers are concrete, the strike invariant is concrete, and the delegation mechanism is concrete. This slide should feel like the "aha moment" for the defense evaluators in the audience.

## Visual Layout
Left side (45%): Five-tier pyramid diagram (see Diagram Spec). Right side (55%): Title "The Authority Architecture" in blue (#2563EB), 24pt. Below: three elements:
1. **Strike Authorization Invariant** — a red-bordered callout box: "Tier 3 minimum (organizational authority) is required for any autonomous engagement. This invariant cannot be overridden by any operator, configuration, or operational urgency. It is enforced by smart contract."
2. **Robot Delegation Example** — a short narrative: "The robot in the opening demo was delegated Tier 5 authority (autonomous, policy-bounded). When it identified an engagement opportunity that required Tier 3 authorization, it could not proceed. It stopped. It requested authority escalation through the DAO governance chain. It waited."
3. **Dynamic Delegations** — a brief callout: "Authority delegations are not static. A commander can grant expanded delegation for a time-limited mission window. That delegation records on-chain and expires automatically."

## Image Prompt
No AI image — the pyramid diagram carries the visual argument.

## Diagram Spec
Five-tier stacked pyramid or block diagram. White background. Five horizontal tiers of decreasing width from bottom (widest) to top (narrowest), representing increasing authority level.

Tiers from bottom to top:
1. **Tier 1 — Individual Operator** [widest, light blue #DBEAFE] — label: "Individual authorization" — annotation: "Personal access, own resources, own actions only"
2. **Tier 2 — Team / Unit** [sky blue #BAE6FD] — label: "Team authorization" — annotation: "Unit-level resources and actions"
3. **Tier 3 — Organizational** [blue #93C5FD] — label: "Organizational authority" — annotation: "MINIMUM for autonomous engagement authorization" — [bold red border on right edge of this tier]
4. **Tier 4 — National** [deeper blue #60A5FA] — label: "National DAO authority" — annotation: "Strategic resource commitment"
5. **Tier 5 — Coalition Strategic** [darkest blue #2563EB, white text] — label: "Coalition DAO — unanimity" — annotation: "Strike authorization: 100% coalition threshold"

Right side annotation: Vertical bracket spanning Tiers 1-2 with label "Robot Tier 5 delegation boundary" and an arrow pointing left with notation "Robot operating here — paused at this line."

A small robot icon (geometric, minimal) positioned at the Tier 1/Tier 2 boundary with an upward arrow labeled "Authority request escalated" pointing toward Tier 3.

Dimensions: pyramid approximately 300px wide at base, 150px tall. Each tier 30px tall. Clean, sharp edges.
